# ProductManagementTool
A simple product management tool that lets you create products and search products in a listing page.

----------

To run the product management tool, first make sure you have installed:
1. Node (Download link: https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. MongoDB (Download link: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/)    

After installing Node and MongoDB, navigate to the project directory on your system in 2 different terminals. In one of the terminals, change directories to the API folder ( \ProductManagementTool\API ).  
1. Run *npm install*
2. run *npm run start*

This will install all of the necessary node packages and then start the database server.

In the second terminal, navigate to the front_end folder ( \ProductManagementTool\front_end )  
1. Run *npm install*
2. Run *npm run dev*

This will install all of the necessary node packages and then start the front end server. You will then be able to use the app on http://localhost:3000/
